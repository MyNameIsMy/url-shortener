Simple url shortener
====================

In order to start application, you need to add in the rood folder of the project the new folder with name 'profiles', 
under it create the another folder with name 'local' and there add the file 'config.properties' with next content:

* datasource.driver=db driver
* datasource.url=db url
* datasource.username=db username
* datasource.password=db password

At the moment project uses the Postgres but at any moment can be extended to using any available database.
